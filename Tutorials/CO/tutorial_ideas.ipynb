    "This tutorial is part of our Chemical Oceanography day. It demonstrates how to do basic analysis and visualization of chemical element observations in the ocean. We will use A,B,and C data which can be downloaded using CMAP API, a giant data database for Earth system observations and modeling. To download the data using API, please register at CMAP and generate your API key.\n",
